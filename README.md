# NSH
the name NSH comes from Nano Scale Shell. this is my toy shell. 

i'm developing it for my learning purpose. i wanted a small shell, so i'm developed one for myself.

## Meaning
my primary goal is to create a shell that i find easy to use.

and, related to the aforementioned, i would like to continue to develop a very small, baptized shell for my use.


# Usage
still in development. Documentation will be made available as the beta version is released.
